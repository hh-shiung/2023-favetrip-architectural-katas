### Performance

Road Warriors is committed to delivering exceptional performance for our 15 million customers, to ensure it remains their preferred travel companion. Our performance requirements encompass various aspects of speed and responsiveness to guarantee a seamless and efficient user experience.

Timely Travel Updates: Road Warriors must promptly deliver trip updates to our users. Updates generated by the source (found by us via email) should be presented in the app within 5 minutes. This ensures that our users are always informed in *close to* real-time, enhancing their travel planning and decision-making, and allowing them flexibility to alter their arrangements should there be any trip delays, cancellations, or changes.

Response Time: To provide a responsive and seamless experience, the app's web version must achieve a response time of 800ms or less, ensuring that users can access information swiftly. Additionally, the mobile app must achieve a First-Contentful-Paint (FCP) time of under 1.4 seconds. These benchmarks guarantee that users can quickly access and interact with the app's content without perceiving any notable delays, no matter which platform they are using.

Rapid Updates: We aim to outperform our competition by ensuring that any updates or changes to travel information are reflected in the app within 5 minutes of their occurrence. This agility sets us apart and allows our users to stay ahead of the curve, making Road Warriors their top choice for travel assistance.

In summary, Road Warriors' performance standards are the best of all applications on the market, and are designed to offer our users unrivaled speed and responsiveness. We are dedicated to delivering timely updates, lightning-fast response times, and rapid information dissemination, ensuring that our users experience a travel companion that exceeds their expectations.
