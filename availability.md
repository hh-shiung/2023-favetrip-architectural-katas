# Availability

Availability is a paramount consideration for Road Warriors, given the nature of our travel app, which provides users with essential travel information and services. Our commitment to availability extends to various key aspects:

* Global Access: Road Warriors is a globally accessible platform, serving users across different time zones and regions. Travel-related needs can arise at any time, whether it's for an early morning red-eye flight or a late-night hotel check-in. Therefore, it's imperative that our services remain available 24/7, ensuring that users can access the app whenever and wherever they need it, no matter where they are in the world.
* Minimal Downtime: To maintain the highest level of service reliability, we have stringent requirements for downtime. Our goal is to limit unplanned downtime to an absolute minimum, allowing for only 5 minutes per month. This requirement ensures that users experience minimal disruptions and can rely on our app consistently.
* Seamless Maintenance: While ensuring minimal unplanned downtime is crucial, we also recognize the necessity of periodic maintenance to keep our platform secure and up to date. To achieve this, we will implement maintenance strategies that minimize service interruptions. This includes careful planning, load balancing, redundancy, and performing maintenance during low-traffic periods to avoid any noticeable impact on our users.

Our dedication to availability is paramount in building and maintaining trust with our users. By providing a reliable and always-accessible platform, we ensure that users can depend on Road Warriors for their travel needs, no matter when or where those needs arise. This trust is the foundation of our credibility in the travel industry.
