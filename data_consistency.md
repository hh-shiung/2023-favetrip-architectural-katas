# Data Consistency

Data consistency is a foundational pillar within the Road Warriors architecture, particularly in our ecosystem comprising microservices and event-driven components. Our commitment to data consistency revolves around the following key principles:

Synchronization Across Databases and Tables: Our architecture is designed to ensure that data remains in sync and consistent across all microservices, databases, and tables. Regardless of which part of the system users interact with, they should encounter a uniform and accurate representation of their travel information.

Event-Driven Data Propagation: Data consistency is maintained through our event-driven approach. Events are the triggers for data updates and serve as the mechanism for propagating changes across the entire system. When a change occurs in one microservice, it generates an event that notifies other relevant microservices, ensuring that data consistency is upheld.

Cross-Service Transactions: In situations where a single operation spans multiple microservices, our architecture supports cross-service transactions. These transactions guarantee that either all operations within the transaction succeed, or none of them do. This approach prevents data inconsistencies that can arise from partial updates across services.

Data Validation and Conflict Resolution: To further enforce data consistency, we employ robust data validation and conflict resolution mechanisms. These mechanisms ensure that data changes are accurate, compliant with predefined standards, and that any conflicts or discrepancies are detected and resolved promptly.

Audit Trails and Logging: Comprehensive audit trails and logging are integral to our data consistency strategy. These records capture all data changes and interactions within our system, allowing us to trace the flow of data and investigate any anomalies. This auditing capability enhances our ability to maintain data integrity consistently.

Our commitment to data consistency within our microservices and event-driven architecture is fundamental to providing users with a seamless and reliable experience. By embracing these principles and practices, we ensure that Road Warriors delivers a cohesive and accurate representation of user data throughout the system, enhancing user confidence in our platform."
